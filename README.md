# ProSync
ProSync - DevsHouse submission from Team Producto!

# The Concept
A Progressive Web App to make competitive programming easier and motivate students to practice more- **ProSync** comes with LeetCode and Gemini Integration to reduce the hassle and make it easier to keep coding and compete with friends, all with the aim of self-improvement.

# Features
- Ability to add people to the leaderboard with just their LeetCode Username
- Ask Gemini to analyse you based on your current LeetCode stats
- A Todo list functionality to stay organised for bigger projects
- Ask Gemini your programming questions without ever leaving the app
- Links to other useful platforms or website (in case you don't like ours)
- (you'll like ours)

# What you need to run it

```python
py -m venv .venv
```
```python
.\.venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
```
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# ProSync's Future
We're aware that the app is _far_ from perfect, but it will always keep improving, with refinements and features being added (trust me, we have a lot of ideas stored up)
